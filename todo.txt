- TODO -------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Anti-bot verification
    [x] User-defined questions
    [x] Main functionality
[x] Ensure HTML in comments isn't parsed
[x] Evaluate names of user configuration keys, try to find a good pattern
[x] Go through and ensure all data loading/checking stuff is actually consistent

        count, etc.
[x] Build out footer (with page numbers and such)
[x] Index page pagination

[x] Ability to delete posts

[/] Server-side post data validation
    [x] Field lengths
    [x] Field types (e-mail, url, etc.)
    [x] Text encoding? Maybe everything is received in unicode?

            need to worry about it as such
